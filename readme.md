# AI Nyanbot (😼,🤖)

**AI Nyanbot** – your favorite cat-themed automated investing companion! 🚀 But before you get any wild ideas, **AI stands for Automated Investing, NOT Artificial Intelligence** – no deep learning, no singularity, just code doing its best to snipe tokens faster than you can say "wen moon?" 🌕

## 🚨 Disclaimer 🚨
This project is in its **prototyping phase** – speed, clean code, and best practices have been *intentionally ignored* for now. **Do NOT use in production unless you enjoy debugging at 3 AM.**

## ⚠️ Open Source, But No Direct Code Contributions ⚠️
Yes, the code is open source, but **we are not accepting PRs** at this point in time. However, we highly appreciate **feedback, bug reports, and ideas** to make Nyanbot even better!

If you want to point out a bug or suggest an improvement, feel free to open an issue. If you include example code to illustrate your point, that’s great! But note that we will **rewrite any submitted code ourselves** before merging, in a similar fashion to how SQLite operates.

🐾 Your insights matter, and we value your input! Just don’t expect a merge button. 😼

## 📜 License
This project is licensed under the **AGPL-3.0**. If you use or modify the code and deploy it publicly, **you must also share your changes**. Sharing is caring! 😼
